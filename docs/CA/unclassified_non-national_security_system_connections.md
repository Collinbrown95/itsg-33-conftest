# (CA-3(3)) UnClassified Non-National Security System Connections

## Definition

The organization prohibits the direct connection of an [Assignment: organization-defined classified, non-national security system] to an external network without the use of [Assignment; organization-defined boundary protection device].

## Additional Guidance

Organizations typically do not have control over external networks (e.g., the Internet). Approved boundary protection devices (e.g., routers, firewalls) mediate communications (i.e., information flows) between unclassified non-national security systems and external networks. This control enhancement is required for organizations processing, storing, or transmitting Protected Information.
