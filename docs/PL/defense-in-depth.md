# (PL-8(1)) Defense-In-Depth

## Definition

(a)The organization designs its security architecture using a defence-in-depth approach that allocates [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to [Assignment: organization-defined locations and architectural layers]; and
(b)The organization designs its security architecture using a defence-in-depth approach that ensures that the allocated security safeguards operate in a coordinated and mutually reinforcing manner.

## Additional Guidance

Organizations strategically allocate security safeguards (procedural, technical, or both) in the security architecture so that adversaries have to overcome multiple safeguards to achieve their objective. Requiring adversaries to defeat multiple mechanisms makes it more difficult to successfully attack critical information resources (i.e., increases adversary work factor) and also increases the likelihood of detection. The coordination of allocated safeguards is essential to ensure that an attack that involves one safeguard does not create adverse unintended consequences (e.g., lockout, cascading alarms) by interfering with another safeguard. Placement of security safeguards is a key activity. Greater asset criticality or information value merits additional layering. Thus, an organization may choose to place anti-virus software at organizational boundary layers, email/web servers, notebook computers, and workstations to maximize the number of related safeguards adversaries must penetrate before compromising the information and information systems.
