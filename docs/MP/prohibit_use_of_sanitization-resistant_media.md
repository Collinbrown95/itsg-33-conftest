# (MP-7(2)) Prohibit Use of Sanitization-Resistant Media

## Definition

The organization prohibits the use of sanitization-resistant media in organizational information systems.

## Additional Guidance

Sanitation-resistance applies to the capability to purge information from media. Certain types of media do not support sanitize commands, or if supported, the interfaces are not supported in a standardized way across these devices. Sanitation-resistant media include, for example, compact flash, embedded flash on boards and devices, solid state drives, and USB removable media.
