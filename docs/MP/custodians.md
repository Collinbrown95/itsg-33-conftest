# (MP-5(3)) Custodians

## Definition

The organization employs an identified custodian during transport of information system media outside of controlled areas.

## Additional Guidance

Identified custodians provide organizations with specific points of contact during the media transport process and facilitate individual accountability. Custodial responsibilities can be transferred from one individual to another as long as an unambiguous custodian is identified at all times.
