## Additional Guidance

This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the MP family. The media protection policy and procedures reflect applicable GC legislation and TBS policies, directives and standards. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures
