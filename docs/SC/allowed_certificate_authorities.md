# (SC-23(5)) Allowed Certificate Authorities

## Definition

The information system only allows the use of [Assignment: organization-defined certificate authorities] for verification of the establishment of protected sessions.

## Additional Guidance

Reliance on certificate authorities (CAs) for the establishment of secure sessions includes, for example, the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and/or Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates. These certificates, after verification by the respective certificate authorities, facilitate the establishment of protected sessions between web clients and web servers.
