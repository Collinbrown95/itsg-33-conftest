# (SC-7(17)) Automated Enforcement of Protocol Formats

## Definition

The information system enforces adherence to protocol formats.

## Additional Guidance

Information system components that enforce protocol formats include, for example, deep packet inspection firewalls and xML gateways. Such system components verify adherence to protocol formats/specifications (e.g., IEEE) at the application layer and identify significant vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by devices operating at the network or transport layers.
