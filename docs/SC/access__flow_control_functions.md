# (SC-3(2)) Access / Flow Control Functions

## Definition

The information system isolates security functions enforcing access and information flow control from non-security functions and from other security functions.

## Additional Guidance

Security function isolation occurs as a result of implementation; the functions can still be scanned and monitored. Security functions that are potentially isolated from access and flow control enforcement functions include, for example, auditing, intrusion detection, and anti-virus functions.
