# (SC-7(14)) Protects Against Unauthorized Physical Connections

## Definition

The organization protects against unauthorized physical connections at [Assignment: organization-defined managed interfaces].

## Additional Guidance

Information systems operating at different security categories or classification levels may share common physical and environmental controls, since the systems may share space within organizational facilities. In practice, it is possible that these separate information systems may share common equipment rooms, wiring closets, and cable distribution paths. Protection against unauthorized physical connections can be achieved, for example, by employing clearly identified and physically separated cable trays, connection frames, and patch panels for each side of managed interfaces with physical access controls enforcing limited authorized access to these items.
