# (SC-7(22)) Separate Subnets for Connecting to Different Security Domains

## Definition

The information system implements separate network addresses (i.e., different subnets) to connect to systems in different security domains.

## Additional Guidance

Decomposition of information systems into subnets helps to provide the appropriate level of protection for network connections to different security domains containing information with different security categories or classification levels.
