# (SC-39(1)) Hardware Separation

## Definition

The information system implements underlying hardware separation mechanisms to facilitate process separation.

## Additional Guidance

Hardware-based separation of information system processes is generally less susceptible to compromise than software-based separation, thus providing greater assurance that the separation will be enforced. Underlying hardware separation mechanisms include, for example, hardware memory management.
