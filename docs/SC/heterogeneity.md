# (SC-29) Heterogeneity

## Definition

(A)The organization employs a diverse set of information technologies for [Assignment: organization-defined information system components] in the implementation of the information system.

## Additional Guidance

Increasing the diversity of information technologies within organizational information systems reduces the impact of potential exploitations of specific technologies and also defends against common mode failures, including those failures induced by supply chain attacks. Diversity in information technologies also reduces the likelihood that the means adversaries use to compromise one information system component will be equally effective against other system components, thus further increasing the adversary work factor to successfully complete planned cyber-attacks. An increase in diversity may add complexity and management overhead which could ultimately lead to mistakes and unauthorized configurations.
