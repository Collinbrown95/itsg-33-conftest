# (SC-36(1)) Polling Techniques

## Definition

The organization employs polling techniques to identify potential faults, errors, or compromises to [Assignment: organization-defined distributed processing and storage components].

## Additional Guidance

Distributed processing and/or storage may be employed to reduce opportunities for adversaries to successfully compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information and information systems. However, distribution of processing and/or storage components does not prevent adversaries from compromising one (or more) of the distributed components. Polling compares the processing results and/or storage content from the various distributed components and ensures that they agree. Polling identifies potential faults, errors, or compromises in distributed processing and/or storage components.
