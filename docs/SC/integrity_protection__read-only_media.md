# (SC-34(2)) Integrity Protection / Read-Only Media

## Definition

The organization protects the integrity of information prior to storage on read-only media and controls the media after such information has been recorded onto the media.

## Additional Guidance

Security safeguards prevent the substitution of media into information systems or the reprogramming of programmable read-only media prior to installation into the systems. Security safeguards include, for example, a combination of prevention, detection, and response.
