# (SC-7(13)) Isolation of Security Tools / Mechanisms / Support Components

## Definition

The organization isolates [Assignment: organization-defined information security tools, mechanisms, and support components] from other internal information system components by implementing physically separate sub-networks with managed interfaces to other components of the system.

## Additional Guidance

Physically separate sub-networks with managed interfaces are useful, for example, in isolating computer network defences from critical operational processing networks to prevent adversaries from discovering the analysis and forensics techniques of organizations.
