# (SC-7(23)) Disable Sender Feedback on Protocol Validation Failure

## Definition

The information system disables feedback to senders on protocol format validation failure.

## Additional Guidance

Disabling feedback to senders when there is a failure in protocol validation format prevents adversaries from obtaining information which would otherwise be unavailable.
