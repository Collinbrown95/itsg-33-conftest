# (CP-2(2)) Capacity Planning

## Definition

The organization conducts capacity planning so that necessary capacity for information processing, telecommunications, and environmental support exists during contingency operations.

## Additional Guidance

Capacity planning is needed because different types of threats (e.g., natural disasters, targeted cyber-attacks) can result in a reduction of the available processing, telecommunications, and support services originally intended to support the organizational missions/business functions. Organizations may need to anticipate degraded operations during contingency operations and factor such degradation into capacity planning.
