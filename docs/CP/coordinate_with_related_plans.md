# (CP-4(1)) Coordinate with Related Plans

## Definition

The organization coordinates contingency plan testing with organizational elements responsible for related plans.

## Additional Guidance

Plans related to contingency plans for organizational information systems include, for example, Business Continuity Plans, Disaster Recovery Plans, Continuity of Operations Plans, Business Recovery Plans, Incident Response Plans, and Emergency Action Plans. This control enhancement does not require organizations to create organizational elements to handle related plans or to align such elements with specific plans. It does require, however, that if such organizational elements are responsible for related plans, organizations should coordinate with those elements.
