# (CP-2(7)) Coordinate with External Service Providers

## Definition

The organization coordinates its contingency plan with the contingency plans of external service providers to ensure that contingency requirements can be satisfied.

## Additional Guidance

When the capability of an organization to successfully carry out its core missions/business functions is dependent on external service providers, developing a timely and comprehensive contingency plan may become more challenging. In this situation, organizations coordinate contingency planning activities with the external entities to ensure that the individual plans reflect the overall contingency needs of the organization.
