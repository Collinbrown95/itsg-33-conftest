# (CP-6) Alternate Storage Site

## Definition

(A)The organization establishes an alternate storage site including necessary agreements to permit the storage and retrieval of information system backup information.
(B)The organization ensures that the alternate storage site provides information security safeguards equivalent to that of the primary site.

## Additional Guidance

Alternate storage sites are sites that are geographically distinct from primary storage sites. An alternate storage site maintains duplicate copies of information and data in the event that the primary storage site is not available. Items covered by alternate storage site agreements include, for example, environmental conditions at alternate sites, access rules, physical and environmental protection requirements, and coordination of delivery/retrieval of backup media. Alternate storage sites reflect the requirements in contingency plans so that organizations can maintain essential missions/business functions despite disruption, compromise, or failure in organizational information systems.
