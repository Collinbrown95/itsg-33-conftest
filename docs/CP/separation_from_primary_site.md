# (CP-7(1)) Separation from Primary Site

## Definition

The organization identifies an alternate processing site that is separated from the primary processing site to reduce susceptibility to the same threats.

## Additional Guidance

Threats that affect alternate processing sites are typically defined in organizational assessments of risk and include, for example, natural disasters, structural failures, hostile cyber-attacks, and errors of omission/commission. Organizations determine what is considered a sufficient degree of separation between primary and alternate processing sites based on the types of threats that are of concern. For one particular type of threat (i.e., hostile cyber-attack), the degree of separation between sites is less relevant.
