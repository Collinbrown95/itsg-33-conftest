# (CP-8(4)) Provider Contingency Plan

## Definition

(a)The organization requires primary and alternate telecommunications service providers to have contingency plans;
(b)The organization reviews provider contingency plans to ensure that the plans meet organizational contingency requirements; and
(c)The organization obtains evidence of contingency testing/training by providers [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].

## Additional Guidance

Reviews of provider contingency plans consider the proprietary nature of such plans. In some situations, a summary of provider contingency plans may be sufficient evidence for organizations to satisfy the review requirement. Telecommunications service providers may also participate in ongoing disaster recovery exercises in coordination with the Public Safety Canada, provincial, and local governments. Organizations may use these types of activities to satisfy evidentiary requirements related to service provider contingency plan reviews, testing, and training.
