# (AU-10(4)) Validate Binding of Information Reviewer Identity

## Definition

(a)The information system validates the binding of the information reviewer identity to the information at the transfer or release points prior to release/transfer between [Assignment: organization-defined security domains]; and
(b)The information system performs [Assignment: organization-defined actions] in the event of a validation error.

## Additional Guidance

This control enhancement prevents the modification of information between review and transfer/release. The validation of bindings can be achieved, for example, by the use of cryptographic checksums. Organizations determine validations are in response to user requests or generated automatically.
