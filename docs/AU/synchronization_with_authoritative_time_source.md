# (AU-8(1)) Synchronization with Authoritative Time Source

## Definition

(a)The information system compares the internal information system clocks [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] with [Assignment: organization-defined authoritative time source]; and
(b)The information system synchronizes the internal system clocks to the authoritative time source when the time difference is greater than [Assignment: organization-defined time period].

## Additional Guidance

This control enhancement provides uniformity of time stamps for information systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network.
