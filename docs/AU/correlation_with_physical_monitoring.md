# (AU-6(6)) Correlation with Physical Monitoring

## Definition

The organization correlates information from audit records with information obtained from monitoring physical access to further enhance the ability to identify suspicious, inappropriate, unusual, or malevolent activity.

## Additional Guidance

The correlation of physical audit information and audit logs from information systems may assist organizations in identifying examples of suspicious behaviour or supporting evidence of such behaviour. For example, the correlation of an individual???s identity for logical access to certain information systems with the additional physical security information that the individual was actually present at the facility when the logical access occurred, may prove to be useful in investigations.
