# (AU-9(2)) Audit Backup on Separate Physical Systems / Components

## Definition

The information system backs up audit records [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] onto a physically different system or system component than the system or component being audited.

## Additional Guidance

This control enhancement helps to ensure that a compromise of the information system being audited does not also result in a compromise of the audit records.
