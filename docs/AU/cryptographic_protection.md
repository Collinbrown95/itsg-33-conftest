# (AU-9(3)) Cryptographic Protection

## Definition

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity of audit information and audit tools.

## Additional Guidance

Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of audit information include, for example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography enabling distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the confidentiality of the secret key used to generate the hash.
