# (AU-4(1)) Transfer to Alternate Storage

## Definition

The information system off-loads audit records [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] onto a different system or media than the system being audited.

## Additional Guidance

Off-loading is a process designed to preserve the confidentiality and integrity of audit records by moving the records from the primary information system to a secondary or alternate system. It is a common process in information systems with limited audit storage capacity; the audit storage is used only in a transitory fashion until the system can communicate with the secondary or alternate system designated for storing the audit records, at which point the information is transferred.
