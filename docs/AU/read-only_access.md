# (AU-9(6)) Read-Only Access

## Definition

The organization authorizes read-only access to audit information to [Assignment: organization-defined subset of privileged users].

## Additional Guidance

Restricting privileged user authorizations to read-only helps to limit the potential damage to organizations that could be caused by such users (e.g., deleting audit records to cover up malicious activity).
