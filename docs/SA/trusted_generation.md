# (SA-10(4)) Trusted Generation

## Definition

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to employ tools for comparing newly generated versions of security-relevant hardware descriptions and software/firmware source and object code with previous versions.

## Additional Guidance

This control enhancement addresses changes to hardware, software, and firmware components between versions during development. In contrast, SA-10 (x) and SA-10 (3) allow organizations to detect unauthorized changes to hardware, software, and firmware components through the use of tools, techniques, and/or mechanisms provided by developers.
