# (IR-4(4)) Information Correlation

## Definition

The organization correlates incident information and individual incident responses to achieve an organization-wide perspective on incident awareness and response.

## Additional Guidance

Sometimes the nature of a threat event, for example, a hostile cyber-attack, is such that it can only be observed by bringing together information from different sources including various reports and reporting procedures established by organizations.
