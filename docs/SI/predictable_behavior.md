# (SI-10(3)) Predictable Behavior

## Definition

The information system behaves in a predictable and documented manner that reflects organizational and system objectives when invalid inputs are received.

## Additional Guidance

A common vulnerability in organizational information systems is unpredictable behaviour when invalid inputs are received. This control enhancement ensures that there is predictable behaviour in the face of invalid inputs by specifying information system responses that facilitate transitioning the system to known states without adverse, unintended side effects.
