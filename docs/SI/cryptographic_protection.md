# (SI-7(6)) Cryptographic Protection

## Definition

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to detect unauthorized changes to software, firmware, and information.

## Additional Guidance

Cryptographic mechanisms used for the protection of integrity include, for example, digital signatures and the computation and application of signed hashes using asymmetric cryptography, protecting the confidentiality of the key used to generate the hash, and using the public key to verify the hash information.
