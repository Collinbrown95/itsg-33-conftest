# (SI-3(7)) Non Signature-Based Detection

## Definition

The information system implements non-signature-based malicious code detection mechanisms.

## Additional Guidance

Non-signature-based detection mechanisms include, for example, the use of heuristics to detect, analyze, and describe the characteristics or behaviour of malicious code and to provide safeguards against malicious code for which signatures do not yet exist or for which existing signatures may not be effective. This includes polymorphic malicious code (i.e., code that changes signatures when it replicates). This control enhancement does not preclude the use of signature-based detection mechanisms.
