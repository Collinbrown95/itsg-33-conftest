# Overview

This project applies a very thin wrapper around [Conftest](https://www.conftest.dev/) to enable Policy-as-Code checks against [ITSG-33](https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/it-security-risk-management-lifecycle-approach-itsg-33) security requirements. The use case for this project is to address itsg-33 compliance checking around **project-specific cloud infrastructure**, as shown in the dashed red box below.
