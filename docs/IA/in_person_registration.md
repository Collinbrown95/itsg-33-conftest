# (IA-4(7)) In Person Registration

## Definition

The organization requires that the registration process to receive an individual identifier be conducted in person before a designated registration authority.

## Additional Guidance

In-person registration reduces the likelihood of fraudulent identifiers being issued because it requires the physical presence of individuals and actual face-to-face interactions with designated registration authorities.
