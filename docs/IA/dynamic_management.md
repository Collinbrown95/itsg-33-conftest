# (IA-4(5)) Dynamic Management

## Definition

The information system dynamically manages identifiers.

## Additional Guidance

In contrast to conventional approaches to identification which presume static accounts for pre-registered users, many distributed information systems including, for example, service-oriented architectures, rely on establishing identifiers at run time for entities that were previously unknown. In these situations, organizations anticipate and provision for the dynamic establishment of identifiers. Pre-established trust relationships and mechanisms with appropriate authorities to validate identities and related credentials are essential.
