# (AT-3(3)) Practical Exercises

## Definition

The organization includes practical exercises in security training that reinforce training objectives.
Supplemental Guidance: Practical exercises may include, for example, security training for software developers that includes simulated cyber-attacks exploiting common software vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows), or spear/whale phishing attacks targeted at senior leaders/executives. These types of practical exercises help developers better understand the effects of such vulnerabilities and appreciate the need for security coding standards and processes.
