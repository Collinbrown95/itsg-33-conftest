# (AC-6(8)) Privilege Levels for Code Execution

## Definition

The information system prevents [Assignment: organization-defined software] from executing at higher privilege levels than users executing the software.

## Additional Guidance

In certain situations, software applications/programs need to execute with elevated privileges to perform required functions. However, if the privileges required for execution are at a higher level than the privileges assigned to organizational users invoking such applications/programs, those users are indirectly provided with greater privileges than assigned by organizations.
