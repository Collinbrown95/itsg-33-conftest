# (AC-8) System Use Notification

## Definition

(A)The information system displays to users [Assignment: organization-defined system use notification message or banner] before granting access to the system that provides privacy and security notices in accordance with the TBS Policy on the Use of Electronic Networks [Reference 5].
(B)The information system retains the notification message or banner on the screen until users acknowledge the usage conditions and take explicit actions to log on to or further access the information system.
(C)The information system for publicly accessible systems:
(a)Displays system use information [Assignment: organization-defined conditions], before granting further access;
(b)Displays references, if any, to monitoring, recording, or auditing that are consistent with privacy accommodations for such systems that generally prohibit those activities; and
(c)Includes a description of the authorized uses of the system.

## Additional Guidance

System use notifications can be implemented using messages or warning banners displayed before individuals log in to information systems. System use notifications are used only for access via logon interfaces with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist. Organizations consider system use notification messages/banners displayed in multiple languages based on specific organizational needs and the demographics of information system users. Organizations also consult with the Departmental Legal Services Branch for legal review and approval of warning banner content
