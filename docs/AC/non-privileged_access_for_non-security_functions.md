# (AC-6(2)) Non-Privileged Access for Non-Security Functions

## Definition

The organization requires that users of information system accounts, or roles, with access to [Assignment: organization-defined security functions or security-relevant information], use non-privileged accounts or roles, when accessing non-security functions.

## Additional Guidance

This control enhancement limits an information system???s exposure to threats when users are operating from within privileged accounts or roles. The inclusion of roles addresses situations where organizations implement access control policies such as RBAC and where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for both the user and all processes acting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between a privileged and non-privileged account.
