# (CM-7(5)) Authorized Software / Whitelisting

## Definition

(a)The organization identifies [Assignment: organization-defined software programs authorized to execute on the information system];
(b)The organization employs a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy to allow the execution of authorized software programs on the information system; and
(c)The organization reviews and updates the list of authorized software programs [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].

## Additional Guidance

The process used to identify software programs that are authorized to execute on organizational information systems is commonly referred to as whitelisting. In addition to whitelisting, organizations consider verifying the integrity of white-listed software programs using, for example, cryptographic checksums, digital signatures, or hash functions. Verification of white-listed software can occur either prior to execution or at system start-up.
