# (CM-5(5)) Limit Production / Operational Privileges

## Definition

(a)The organization limits privileges to change information system components and system-related information within a production or operational environment; and
(b)The organization reviews and re-evaluates privileges [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].

## Additional Guidance

In many organizations, information systems support multiple core missions/business functions. Limiting privileges to change information system components with respect to operational systems is necessary because changes to a particular information system component may have far-reaching effects on mission/business processes supported by the system where the component resides. The complex, many-to-many relationships between systems and mission/business processes are in some cases, unknown to developers.
