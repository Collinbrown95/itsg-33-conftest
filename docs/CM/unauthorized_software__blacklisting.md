# (CM-7(4)) Unauthorized Software / Blacklisting

## Definition

(a)The organization identifies [Assignment: organization-defined software programs not authorized to execute on the information system];
(b)The organization employs an allow-all, deny-by-exception policy to prohibit the execution of unauthorized software programs on the information system; and
(c)The organization reviews and updates the list of unauthorized software programs [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].

## Additional Guidance

The process used to identify software programs that are not authorized to execute on organizational information systems is commonly referred to as blacklisting. Organizations can implement CM-7 (5) instead of this control enhancement if whitelisting (the stronger of the two policies) is the preferred approach for restricting software program execution.
